# Obsidian Task Badge Count

This project is to work around the lack of badge counts in Obsidian.  If you work for obsidian, all you need to do to retire this app is to allow plugins to set badge counts.

All it does is look using the [Local Rest API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) plugin it pulls the tasks in your vault that are not completed.

This has only been used on MacOS but it SHOULD work on Windows and some Linux flavors.  

Please feel free to contribute if you want to make this better.
